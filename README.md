**AI-powered GitHub issue investigation — from issue to pull request.**

IssuePilot connects to your GitHub account, analyzes a repository issue using a multi-stage AI pipeline, identifies the root cause, generates a code patch, and automatically creates a fix branch with a pull request. Developers get an actionable fix without manually tracing code across the repository.

---

## The Problem

When a developer encounters a GitHub issue, the investigation workflow is slow and manual:

1. Read and understand the issue
2. Search the repository for relevant code
3. Identify which files are involved
4. Trace the root cause through the codebase
5. Collect evidence linking the bug to specific code
6. Design a solution
7. Implement the fix
8. Create a branch
9. Commit the changes
10. Open a pull request

IssuePilot automates steps 2 through 10 using AI.

### Step-by-Step

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **GitHub OAuth** | User authenticates via GitHub. IssuePilot receives a token with repository read access. |
| **Repository Selection** | IssuePilot lists the user's accessible repositories. |
| **Issue Selection** | User picks a GitHub issue to investigate. |
| **Repository Index** | IssuePilot fetches the repository file tree, filters irrelevant files, and builds a fingerprint (language, framework, project type). |
| **Relevant File Discovery** | AI identifies which source files are most likely related to the issue, using the issue description and repository structure. |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | AI analyzes the relevant source code and issue context to identify the underlying cause of the bug. |
| **Evidence Extraction** | AI extracts concrete code references — specific files, line ranges, and explanations — that support the root cause. |
| **Solution Generation** | AI proposes an actionable solution with implementation steps, affected files, and risk assessment. |
| **Patch Generation** | AI generates a unified diff patch that implements the proposed solution. |
| **Create Fix Branch** | IssuePilot creates a new branch from the repository's default branch. |
| **Apply Patch & Commit** | The generated patch is applied to the fix branch. Each file is fetched, patched, and committed via the GitHub Contents API. |
| **Create Pull Request** | A pull request is automatically created on GitHub, linking the fix branch to the default branch. |

## AI Pipeline

IssuePilot uses a context-aware, multi-stage AI pipeline. Each stage receives context from previous stages, building toward a complete investigation.

### Stage 1: Relevant File Discovery

- **Input:** Issue title/body, repository file tree, repository fingerprint
- **Output:** Ranked list of relevant source files with relevance scores
- **Storage:** `relevant_files` artifact in `analysis_artifacts` table
- **Fallback:** Deterministic keyword-based pre-filter if AI returns no valid results

### Stage 2: Root Cause Analysis

- **Input:** Issue context, relevant files, source code (truncated to fit context window)
- **Output:** Root cause summary, explanation, confidence score, affected files
- **Storage:** `root_cause` artifact in `analysis_artifacts` table

### Stage 3: Evidence Extraction

- **Input:** Issue context, root cause analysis, source code
- **Output:** Concrete evidence references (file paths, line ranges, explanations)
- **Storage:** `evidence` artifact in `analysis_artifacts` table

### Stage 4: Solution Generation

- **Input:** Issue context, root cause, evidence, source code
- **Output:** Solution summary, implementation steps, affected files, risks, confidence
- **Storage:** `solution` artifact in `analysis_artifacts` table

### Stage 5: Patch Generation

- **Input:** Issue context, root cause, evidence, solution, source code
- **Output:** Unified diff with file paths, hunks, and line-level changes
- **Storage:** `patch` artifact in `analysis_artifacts` table

### Context Budget Management

Each context builder estimates token usage and truncates source code to fit within model context windows. A 70% safety threshold ensures models have room to generate output.

---

## AI Provider Architecture

IssuePilot supports multiple AI providers with intelligent fallback. The system tries free models first, then falls back to paid providers if needed.

### Configured Providers

| Provider | Models | Cost | Context Window |
|----------|--------|------|----------------|
| **OpenCode Zen** | mimo-v2.5-free, nemotron-3-ultra-free, nemotron-3.5-lightning-free, and 4 more | Free | 128K |
| **OpenRouter** | DeepSeek V4 Flash, Qwen3 Coder, GLM 5.2, Kimi K2.5, and 14 more | Free | 128K |
| **Chutes** | Qwen3.5-397B-TEE, DeepSeek V4 Flash TEE, Kimi K2.6 TEE | Free | 131K |
| **Z.AI / GLM** | GLM 4.7 Flash, GLM FlashX | Free | 128K |
| **DeepSeek** | deepseek-v4-flash, deepseek-v4-pro | Paid | 131K |
| **Gemini** | gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-3.7-flash | Paid | 1M |

### Model Selection

Models are scored on five dimensions (0-5 scale): coding ability, reasoning, speed, context window, and cost. Each analysis task (root cause, evidence, solution, patch) has different scoring weights, so the optimal model varies by stage.

### Fallback Behavior

1. If Chutes is configured, try Chutes models first for the task
2. Score all configured models by task-specific weights
3. Filter models that can't fit the estimated context
4. Try models in score order (free models prioritized)
5. On failure, classify the error (auth, rate limit, timeout, context too large, etc.)
6. Auth errors throw immediately; other errors trigger fallback to next model

### Environment Variables

All AI provider keys are server-side only (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix). Set only the providers you want to use — unconfigured providers are automatically skipped.

## GitHub Integration

### OAuth Flow

IssuePilot uses Supabase's GitHub OAuth provider. The flow:

1. User clicks "Continue with GitHub"
2. Redirected to GitHub OAuth authorization
3. GitHub redirects back to Supabase callback
4. Supabase exchanges code for session
5. Session contains `provider_token` (GitHub access token)
6. Token is used server-side for all GitHub API calls

### Repository Access

- Lists user's accessible repositories via `GET /user/repos`
- Fetches repository file tree via `GET /git/trees/{tree_sha}?recursive=1`
- Retrieves source file contents via `GET /contents/{path}?ref={sha}`
- Fetches issue details and comments via GitHub REST API

### Branch Creation and PR

- Creates a new branch from the default branch HEAD: `issuepilot/fix/issue-{number}-{randomId}`
- Applies patches using the GitHub Contents API (`PUT /contents/{path}`)
- Each file is fetched from the fix branch, patched in-memory, and committed
- A pull request is automatically created via `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls`
- The default branch is never directly modified

---

## Patch / Pull Request Flow

IssuePilot does not simply output an AI-generated answer. It produces a working pull request on GitHub.

### What Happens

1. AI generates a unified diff for each affected file
2. IssuePilot creates a new branch: `repolens/fix/issue-{number}-{randomId}`
3. For each file in the patch:
   - Fetches the current file content from the fix branch
   - Applies the generated hunks to produce the patched content
   - Commits the change via the GitHub Contents API
4. A pull request is automatically created linking the fix branch to the default branch
5. The developer can review the PR on GitHub and merge when satisfied

### Why This Matters

- The fix is real, testable, and reviewable on GitHub
- The developer can run CI/CD checks on the generated PR
- The default branch is never directly modified
- The developer retains full control over what gets merged

---

## Example End-to-End Test

### Test Scenario

Use a repository with a known bug. For example:

- **Repository:** A project with an intentional calculation error
- **Issue:** A bug report describing incorrect behavior
- **Expected:** IssuePilot identifies the buggy file, explains the root cause, and generates a patch that fixes the calculation

### Expected Flow

```
GitHub Issue: "Calculator returns wrong total for discount codes"
     ↓
IssuePilot Relevant Files: src/services/calculator.ts
     ↓
Root Cause: The discount amount is subtracted from the subtotal
            before tax calculation, but the code subtracts it
            after tax, resulting in an overcharge.
     ↓
Evidence: src/services/calculator.ts lines 45-52 —
          applyDiscount() called after calculateTax()
     ↓
Solution: Move applyDiscount() call before calculateTax()
     ↓
Patch: Reorder function calls in calculateTotal()
     ↓
Branch: repolens/fix/issue-42-a1b2c3
     ↓
Commit: "fix: resolve issue #42"
     ↓
Pull Request: Created on GitHub
```

## Security

- OAuth tokens and API keys are never exposed to the client
- All AI provider keys are server-side only
- Row-level security ensures users can only access their own analyses
- The default branch is never directly modified — only fix branches are created
- Generated patches should be reviewed before merging
- Never commit `.env.local` or any file containing secrets

---

## Known Limitations

- AI-generated analysis may be incorrect for complex or ambiguous issues
- Model availability and rate limits can affect analysis speed
- Issues with insufficient description may produce lower-quality results
- Complex repositories with many large files may exceed context windows
- Generated patches should always be reviewed before merging
- The system requires at least one configured AI provider to function
